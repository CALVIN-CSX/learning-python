# My First Godot Game Development Experience 🎮

I just finished creating my very first game in Godot — and the experience was **extremely fun**!  
From the moment I started, I felt excited the whole time as I kept making progress step by step.  

## 🌱 What I Learned
This small project turned into a crash course in game development.  
I got hands-on experience in so many different areas, including:
- 🌍 World building  
- ⚙️ Implementing physics with Godot  
- 🎨 Game design and art design  
- 🕹️ Character animation (Idle, Run, Jump)  
- 👾 Enemy AI (slime patrol)  
- 🎵 Adding music and sound effects  
- 🏆 Creating a coin collection and scoreboard system  

Each of these was a new challenge, and together they gave me a much deeper understanding of how games come together.

## 🎯 How It Felt
Honestly, I felt **really good** working on this project.  
There was a sense of excitement as I saw the game come to life with every feature I added.  

## 🚀 What’s Next
I also realized that I need to:
- Get more comfortable with the concepts I just learned  
- Practice and reinforce these skills so they become second nature  
- Keep building more small projects to expand my knowledge  

This is only the beginning of my journey into game development, and I can’t wait to learn more!

✨ Overall, this first project showed me how fun and rewarding game development can be.  
I’m looking forward to building on this foundation and creating even better projects in the future.
