# Day 3: Python Modules, Time Functions & File Handling

Today was a shift from just writing scripts to understanding how Python works behind the scenes ‚Äî especially with modules, time utilities, and file operations.

---

## üì¶ Python Modules

- Learned how to **import modules** using both `import module_name` and `from module import function`.
- Understood how to **create my own module** and use it in another file.
- Explored the concept of `__pycache__` and why it gets generated.

---

## üïì Time & Date Handling

- Used the `time` module:
  - `time.time()`, `time.ctime()` 
- Used the `datetime` module:
  - Got current date & time
  - Formatted time using `.strftime()`
  - Parsed strings to datetime with `.strptime()`

These utilities are going to be very useful for file organization and automation tasks later.

## üìÅ File Handling

Created a new directory called `File_Handling/` and practiced:

- **Reading Files** using `open()` and `.read()`
- **Writing to Files** using `"w"` and `"a"` modes
- **Detecting Files**: checking if a file exists before working with it
- Understood the difference between `with open(...)` and regular file opening (and why `with` is preferred)

Also added a sample `test_directory` with input/output files for testing file I/O logic.

## üîç Observations

- Learned that you don‚Äôt need to delay uploading a project until it's complete ‚Äî GitHub repos can evolve.
- Realized the amount of built-in functionality Python has is *overwhelming*, so I need to revise these often.
