# üß† 005. My First Project: File Automation (Python + Watchdog)

This was my very first personal utility project built using Python. It aims to organize files as soon as they are downloaded ‚Äî something I‚Äôve always wanted my PC to do automatically.

Below are the problems I faced, solutions I implemented, and thoughts I had while building this project:

---

## üîç Problems Faced & Solutions

### 1. Temporary/Incomplete Files Getting Moved Too Early

**Problem:**  
Files like `.crdownload`, `.part`, and `.tmp` were getting moved before the download completed.

**Solution:**  
I added a check to skip files with these extensions.

These extensions are ignored using:

```python
if filename.endswith(('.crdownload', '.part', '.tmp')):
    return
```

### 2. Files Being Moved Before They Were Accessible

**Problem:**  
Even after skipping temp extensions, some files triggered errors when accessed too quickly (especially larger files like `.rar`).

**Solution:**  
I implemented a `while` loop that repeatedly checks if the file is accessible using `os.path.exists()` and only then tries to move it.

Also added error handling for `PermissionError` and a small `sleep` delay.

This ensures the file is moved only after it's fully available.

### 3. Hardcoding Paths vs Using a Config File

**Problem:**  
Initially, I used a hardcoded Python dictionary for extensions and their paths.

**Solution:**  
Moved all configurations to `mapping.json` to separate logic from data.

This keeps the code clean and allows editing paths without touching the code.

---

### 4. Multiple Loops or Complex Logic

**Problem:**  
I thought I needed multiple nested loops or timers to detect downloaded files reliably.

**Solution:**  
The `watchdog` observer with a simple loop was enough.

Adding intelligent conditions and file state checks made the code robust without unnecessary complexity.

---

### 5. Understanding File Events and Confusion in Execution

**Problem:**  
Initially, I was confused about how `watchdog` works and how `on_created()` gets triggered.

**Solution:**  
After multiple tests, I understood it only triggers when the final file appears ‚Äî not during intermediate download stages (as long as temp extensions are used).

This event-based system actually makes it easier to keep the script efficient.

---

### 6. EXE Creation & Auto-Startup

**Problem:**  
I wanted this project to run at boot and didn‚Äôt want to keep launching Python scripts.

**Solution:**  
Used `pyinstaller` to convert the script to `.exe`.

Next step is to add this `.exe` to Windows startup manually or through a registry/script.

## üí¨ Personal Reflection

I felt a lot of satisfaction when I saw my files being automatically moved ‚Äî like I had solved a real problem for myself.

Initially, I felt frustrated dealing with temp files and silent errors. But debugging them helped me learn about file systems, download behaviors, and event-driven logic.

Also, separating logic and configuration using `mapping.json` made me realize how clean and scalable good architecture can be.

It may look like a small utility script, but building this taught me a lot about:

- ‚úÖ Practical use of Python libraries  
- ‚úÖ Real-world problems in automation  
- ‚úÖ Thinking beyond textbook examples  
- ‚úÖ Structuring code for clarity  

This was a meaningful and empowering project for me. üîß
