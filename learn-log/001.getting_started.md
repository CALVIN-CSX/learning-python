# Day 1: From IDLE to PyCharm, Functions, OOP & GitHub 🚀

Today I finally shifted from **IDLE** to **PyCharm**.  
The dev experience feels smoother and cleaner — it almost felt like magic when the code started completing itself. Once I understood the UI and how to create projects, PyCharm just *clicked*.

## 🔧 What I Learned

### 🐍 Python Functions & OOP:
- Wrote my first **functions** in Python
- Explored OOP concepts:
  - `self` and `cls`
  - Class vs instance variables  
- Related `self` and `cls` to *micro and macro* concepts from economics — which made everything much clearer.

### 👀 Watchdog:
- Learned the basics of the **watchdog** library (monitors file changes)
- Planning to use it in a **custom file-organizer project** in the future

### 💻 GitHub:
- Installed **GitHub Desktop**
- Created my **first public repository**
- Uploaded my Python learning files  
- It was simpler than I expected — feels great to track my learning journey.
