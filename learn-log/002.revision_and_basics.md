# Day 2: Problem Solving, Repo Cleanup & Rediscovering Python

Today was all about building muscle memory, organizing my learning repository, and reconnecting with Python after spending some time with Java.  
It felt both strange and refreshing — but Python’s simplicity made the transition smooth.

I was initially puzzled by ChatGPT’s solution to **Problem 003** (see `problems/` directory).  
At first, I thought the condition was checking for the full word `'aeiou'`, but I later realized that the code checks each character in the input string **individually** against the vowels — not as one string.  
This clarified that it performs a **per-character match**, regardless of where the vowels appear in the input.

## 🔁 Switching Back from Java to Python

After working with Java for a while, coming back to Python felt like shifting gears — from strict structure to effortless flow.  
Initially, I missed semicolons and type declarations, but Python’s clean syntax quickly reminded me why it feels so natural.

> _The friendliness of the language is like a warm welcome back — no compilation delays, no boilerplate, just logic and expression._

## 🧩 Problem Solving & Logic Building

To rebuild my foundation, I solved a few beginner-level problems:

- ✅ **Sum of Digits**
  - ✅ **Reverse a String using Slicing**
  - ✅ **Count Vowels in a String (case-insensitive)**

These helped reinforce:

- `for` loops  
  - `input()` handling  
  - Type conversions (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)  
  - String methods like `.lower()`  
  - Slicing (`[::-1]`, `[start:end]`)

## 🗂️ Repository Cleanup & Learning Folder Structure

I also spent time organizing my GitHub repository:

- Created **separate folders** for learning scripts and problems
  - Wrote clear **docstrings** and top-of-file summaries
  - Used **one `.py` file per problem** for better clarity and tracking

> _It now feels more like a personal dev journal than a random file dump — which is exactly what I aimed for with #LearnInPublic._
