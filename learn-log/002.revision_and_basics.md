# Day 2: Problem Solving, Repo Cleanup & Rediscovering Python

Today was all about building muscle memory, cleaning up my learning repo, and embracing Python again after a long time with Java.  
It felt both strange and refreshing — but Python’s simplicity made the transition smooth.

## 🔁 Switching Back from Java to Python

After working with Java for a while, coming back to Python felt like shifting gears—from strict structure to effortless flow.  
While at first it was a little weird not having to write semicolons or declare types, Python's beginner-friendly syntax reminded me why I fell in love with it in the first place.

> _The friendliness of the language is like a warm welcome back — no compilation delays, no boilerplate, just logic and expression._

## 🧩 Problem Solving & Logic Building

To rebuild my foundation, I solved a few beginner-level problems:

- ✅ **Sum of Digits**
- ✅ **Reverse a String using Slicing**
- ✅ **Count Vowels in a String (case-insensitive)**

These were simple but effective exercises that helped me revise:

- `for` loops  
- `input()` handling  
- Type conversions (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)  
- String methods like `.lower()` and slicing (`[::-1]`, `[start:end]`)

## 🗂️ Repository Cleanup & Learning Folder Structure

I also improved my GitHub repo by:

- Creating **separate folders** for learning scripts and solved problems
- Writing clear **docstrings** and **top-of-file summaries**
- Keeping one `.py` per problem for clarity

> _It already feels more like a personal dev journal than just a dump of files — which is what I wanted when I started learning in public._
