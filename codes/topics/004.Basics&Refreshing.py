  Python Basics Refresher

This program is a personal revision of core Python concepts to refresh my memory.
It includes examples of:

ğŸ”¹ Variable declarations and printing (including f-strings)
ğŸ”¹ Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
ğŸ”¹ Taking input and using typecasting (int, float, str, bool)
ğŸ”¹ Boolean logic and input validation
ğŸ”¹ Using string methods like .lower()
ğŸ”¹ Loops: for loops, while loops, and user-driven loop exits
ğŸ”¹ Basic user interaction and input-based flow control
ğŸ”¹ Truthy/falsy check using type conversion
ğŸ”¹ Slicing

Note: This script also includes personal notes and exploratory comments
for better conceptual clarity during learning.
