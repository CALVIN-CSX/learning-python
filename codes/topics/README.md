## ‚úçÔ∏è Format

Each script:
- Focuses on **one core concept**
- Uses inline comments and small examples
- May contain notes or mini docstrings

## üìå Purpose

To deepen my conceptual understanding of Python by:
- Writing code that isolates specific ideas
- Referencing back for quick refreshers
- Building confidence before applying to projects
