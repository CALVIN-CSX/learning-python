# üß© Problem Solving in Python

This folder contains beginner-level Python problems that I solved to strengthen my logic, syntax, and foundational understanding of the language.

Each file in this directory addresses a single problem and includes:
- A clear problem statement in the form of a docstring
- Sample input/output for reference
- A working solution with readable, well-commented code

## ‚úÖ Problems Included

| Filename             | Description                             |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `sum_of_digits.py`   | Calculates the sum of digits in an integer |
| `palindrome.py`      | Checks whether a string is a palindrome |
| `count_vowels.py`    | Counts vowels in a string (case-insensitive) |

More problems will be added as I continue my learning.

## üìå Format Followed

Each problem is solved in a separate `.py` file and includes:
- Problem description (as a docstring)
- Example usage
- Clean, modular code

This helps keep things organized and readable‚Äîfor both future review and potential sharing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Goals

- Add a `README` entry for each new problem added
